# Jo Zapf — Junior software engineer (in training) with years of hands-on production/ops responsibility

I’m a **FIAE (IHK) career switcher** with a **DevOps-adjacent** focus: building software that runs reliably under real operating conditions — **CI/CD**, **Docker**, **Linux**, **Security**, and **system integration** included.  
My background combines **hands-on IT responsibility** with a long-standing **autodidactic cross-media / web** foundation, which helps me translate requirements into production-ready, maintainable solutions.

**Keywords:** FIAE · Junior Developer · DevOps · CI/CD · Docker · Linux · Security · Python · Shell · System Integration · Git · GitHub Actions

## Current focus (DevOps-adjacent engineering)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, versioned releases, PR workflows, staged deployments (dev → staging → prod)
- **Containers & operations**: Docker / Docker Compose, reproducible builds, logging/metrics, rollbacks
- **Linux & Security**: hardening, patching, backup & recovery, secrets handling (least privilege, redaction, zero-trust mindset)
- **Software development**: Python & Java (formal training + projects), web engineering (Next.js / Node.js)

## Tech stack (compact)
**Currently working with:** Python · Java · Shell (Bash) · JavaScript (basic) | Level: foundations + steady project practice  
**DevOps/Infra:** Docker · Docker Compose · Linux · CI/CD (GitHub Actions) · Monitoring/Logging (project-dependent)  
**Web:** Next.js / Node.js · HTML/CSS  
**Security:** secrets handling · least privilege · zero-trust-oriented approaches
