## Snapshot
- **Bridging Dev** (since 2025) **↔ Ops **(since 2018)**:** I bring a strong operations & system-integration background into software engineering. Learning and building with production constraints in mind.
Background since 1999: autodidactic work in project- & event-management, networks, digital cross-media/web and technical problem-solving.
- **Proven responsibility:** IT Lead (hands-on, technical) · external specialists coordination / Digital & Media (02/2020–10/2024) — network design, server/client ops, security & backup concepts, high-demand event/B2B/B2C setups.
- **Business ↔ Tech bridge:** translated leadership/customer goals into implementable requirements and reliable operations.
- **Software engineering (in training):** **Python/Java building up**; strongest value today is **system integration + operations + automation**.
- **Automation focus exemplary:** security-driven ops automation in **Shell/Bash** — expanded to include **API-based alerting (SMS/RCS)** for for logging and notification at critical states.

## Fast scan

- **System integration & automation:** glue code, APIs, workflows, reproducible environments, pragmatic runbooks
- **DevOps foundations:** Docker/Compose, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), staged deployments, rollbacks (project-dependent)
- **Security mindset:** zero-trust-oriented thinking, least privilege, secrets handling, defense-in-depth
- **Platforms:** Linux + Windows (incl. WSL where useful), troubleshooting under pressure
